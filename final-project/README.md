## Feedback Summary

1. During the lab session, I received a lot of helpful feedback on my website concepts, focusing on how to make each idea clearer, more engaging, and easier for users to interact with. For Design Time Capsule, the main critique was about clarifying its purpose. I was asked to consider if the platform should guide users through their own personal design journey or if it should showcase general design history. If it’s for personal use, I’d need to add an upload feature so users can input their work; if it’s for a broader scope and general history, I’d need to carefully use and select appropriate synthetic data to make the content feel relatable. During the lab session, other students also encouraged me to make the experience more intuitive for beginners who are the primary audience for site. Narrowing the scope of the site would help.

2. For Meditation Music, the feedback focused on organizing the music tracks to support easy browsing by mood or meditation type. I was advised to label and categorize the tracks thoughtfully, which would require extensive planning. Another critique involved potential copyright or licensing issues when using pre-loaded tracks or external APIs from existing music sites. Users may also want a more personalized experience, so integrating features that allow them to save favorites, create playlists, or receive tailored recommendations would add value.

3. Lastly, for Global Architecture Explorer, my TA highlighted the need to push the interactive elements beyond simple map navigation. Students from class suggested adding features like contextual information or even gamified elements to make exploration more engaging. The TA also reminded me to consider usability principles, as emphasized in this course, to make the platform both educational and enjoyable for any user. 


## Feedback Digestion

Digest the feedback you got in the lab (\~300 words). Indicate which critique you will act on in your next design and why you chose to incorporate/dismiss pieces of critique.

The lab feedback gave me a lot to think about, especially for my Design Time Capsule concept, which I find particularly promising for design students and beginners discovering design. This concept could fill a unique gap, offering a resource that showcases important moments in design, particularly in interaction design. Based on the feedback, I'll refine the focus to present a curated history of interaction design specifically. This narrower scope feels more manageable and aligns better with the goal of making the site a practical learning tool rather than an overwhelming collection of broad design history.

One critique I plan to act on is the recommendation to use thoughtfully selected synthetic data if I decide not to allow user uploads. Curating synthetic examples that are relatable, clear, and tied to notable design concepts could make the site more engaging and informative. This way, even users who are brand new to design could see examples and interact with the content without needing prior design experience. I’ll also work on making the layout intuitive, ensuring it’s accessible and easy to navigate. I want the design to feel friendly and approachable, without clutter that could deter novice users.

For the other concepts, I’ll keep the feedback on Meditation Music in mind for future iterations, like adding personalized playlists and resolving potential licensing issues if I decide to pursue it. And with Global Architecture Explorer, the emphasis on gamification and user engagement was valuable, but I feel these additions are less critical for my immediate goals and can be considered later if the concept develops further. For now, my priority is refining Design Time Capsule to create an intuitive, digestible resource specifically geared toward the needs of design students.
